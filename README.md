## üî¨ Lab Details

### Lab01Task: List Performance Comparison

This lab compares the performance of `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` in Java for various operations such as filling, random access, sequential access, and insertions at the beginning, end, and middle of the list. It demonstrates the trade-offs between these two common list implementations.

**Key Files:**

*   `ListPerformanceComparison.java`: Contains the main logic for comparing `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` performance.

### Lab02Sorting: Sorting Algorithms Performance Comparison

This module implements and compares the performance of several sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Shell Sort. It provides a framework to generate arrays of different sizes and measure the execution time of each sorting method.

**Key Files:**

*   `ArrayGenerator.java`: Utility to generate arrays for sorting.
*   `BubbleSorter.java`, `MergeSorter.java`, `QuickSorter.java`, `ShellSorter.java`: Implementations of various sorting algorithms.
*   `Sorter.java`: Interface for sorting algorithms.
*   `SorterFactory.java`: Factory to get `Sorter` implementations.
*   `SortingPerformance.java`: Main class for running sorting performance tests.
*   `SortingType.java`: Enum for different sorting types.

### Lab03Recursion: Recursion and Iteration Examples

This lab explores the concepts of recursion and iteration through various examples, including factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence generation, and sum of digits calculation. It compares recursive and iterative approaches for these problems.

**Key Files:**

*   `FibonacciCalculator.java`: Calculates Fibonacci numbers using both recursive and iterative methods.
*   `fCalc.java`: Calculates factorials using both recursive and iterative methods.
*   `Resolvesumm.java`: Calculates the sum of digits of a number.
*   `SumCalculator.java`: Calculates the sum of two numbers (simple example).
*   `Main.java`: Entry point to demonstrate the functionality of the recursive and iterative examples.

### Lab04BST: Binary Search Tree Implementation

This module provides a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST). It includes functionalities for inserting, deleting, and finding nodes within the tree. The `Node` class represents the structure of the BST.

**Key Files:**

*   `Node.java`: Implements the Node structure and core BST operations (insert, delete, find, getNodeCount).
*   `NodeTest.java`: JUnit tests for the `Node` class.

### Lab05: Data Validation and Manipulation

This lab focuses on data validation and manipulation, specifically demonstrating phone number validation using regular expressions. It includes classes for validation, deletion, and replacement operations.

**Key Files:**

*   `Validation.java`: Contains logic for validating phone numbers using a regex pattern.
*   `Deleter.java`, `Replacement.java`: (Likely contain logic for deletion and replacement operations, though specific functionality would require further inspection).
*   `DeleterTest.java`, `ReplacementTest.java`, `ValidationTest.java`: JUnit tests for the respective utility classes.
